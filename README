DOG OR NOT??

Using ML Learning to train resnet18 on different animal images and differentiate them from our primary target: 'Dogs'.

As you initialize the Jupyter code, it will build a folder called "dog_or_not" and inside that folder it will populate more folders of animals with their corresponding images.

We will train our model with these images to be able to correctly identify the unique animals and compare them to a dog with a probability of likeness

Essentially, our model will return which 'Animal' it thinks is being fed into it, and return the probability of it being a 'dog'

This is done by inputting the name of the test images in '/test_imgs/' i.e 'coyote.jpg' into our learn.predict() function

### example ###
learn.predict('coyote.jpg') 

Feel free to explore with uploading different animals in our test_imgs folder.
As of now, our model will only be able to identify the current animals: cat, dog, coyote, ferret, guinea pig, honey badger, rabbit, raccoon, skunk, wolf, and wolverine.
